# Castle of the Winds, save file notes and utilities

Castle of the Winds is a Windows 3.1 roguelike game created by Rick Saada. It was published in 1993 by Epic MegaGames.

Rick Saada [released the game for free](https://web.archive.org/web/20031127042908/http://www.exmsft.com:80/~ricks/) in 2003.

The 16-bit, Windows 3.1 version requires either a VM or a shim like [WineVDM](https://github.com/otya128/winevdm) to run on 64-bit Windows.

There's an excellent interview with Rick on the development of Castle of the Winds
